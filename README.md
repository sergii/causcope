# Causcope

Causcope is an open, machine-readable semantic layer for software troubleshooting.

It is designed for two consumers at the same time:

1. **Humans** - to learn how software systems fail, how to reason about incidents, and how system design concepts relate to real failure modes.
2. **Machines and agents** - to classify observations, evaluate hypotheses, select diagnostic probes, and explain why a diagnostic action should happen next.

The project starts from a small executable vertical slice around **high CPU utilization** and grows toward a broader debugging ontology.

## Core idea

Causcope models a diagnostic loop explicitly:

```text
symptom
  -> observations
  -> candidate hypotheses
  -> predictions
  -> probes / experiments
  -> findings
  -> hypothesis updates
  -> cause / contributing factors
  -> mitigation / fix
  -> verification / prevention
```

The long-term goal is to make this loop useful both as documentation and as a deterministic reasoning substrate for developer tools and AI agents.

## Design principles

- **One semantic source, multiple projections.** Human documentation, agent context, CLI output, APIs, MCP resources, and websites should derive from the same canonical knowledge.
- **Knowledge first. Tools second. AI third.** Causcope should not depend on Datadog, OpenTelemetry, Kubernetes, Ruby, or an LLM. Those are adapters and consumers.
- **Stable machine-addressable IDs.** Product naming may change; semantic IDs should not.
- **Falsification matters.** A useful hypothesis defines what evidence would support it and what evidence would make it less likely.
- **Transport agnostic.** CLI, embedded libraries, MCP, HTTP, gRPC, or Unix domain sockets are integration choices above the semantic core.
- **Human-readable and machine-usable.** Every concept should teach something to a person and be addressable by software.

## Causal projection

The semantic causal graph can be projected as stable JSON before adding any transport-specific adapter.

Find the shortest directed causal path:

```bash
python scripts/causal_projection.py --pretty path \
  hypothesis.network.packet_corruption \
  observation.network.transport_latency
```

Look backward from an observation to plausible causal antecedents:

```bash
python scripts/causal_projection.py --pretty causes \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions
```

Bound reverse traversal when a consumer wants a local causal neighborhood:

```bash
python scripts/causal_projection.py --pretty causes \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --max-depth 1
```

The JSON contract is defined by `schema/causal-projection.schema.json`. CLI, MCP, HTTP, and other adapters should consume this projection contract instead of reimplementing graph semantics.

## Causal ranking

A projection can also rank upstream **hypotheses** for an observed target without pretending to calculate a universal probability.

With only TCP retransmissions as the target, packet loss ranks ahead of packet corruption because packet loss directly and strongly predicts retransmissions through a shorter evidence-backed causal path:

```bash
python scripts/causal_ranking.py \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --pretty
```

Add current observations to change the ranking transparently. Receiver-side TCP integrity errors move packet corruption ahead because that observation lies directly on its causal path and is a strong hypothesis prediction:

```bash
python scripts/causal_ranking.py \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --observed observation.network.tcp_integrity_errors \
  --pretty
```

Known-absent observations can penalize a causal path or an explicit hypothesis falsifier:

```bash
python scripts/causal_ranking.py \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --absent observation.network.tcp_integrity_errors \
  --pretty
```

Ranking is deterministic and ordinal. The output exposes every factor used for ordering: conflicts, observed causal path nodes, matching hypothesis predictions by declared strength, weakest causal edge strength, evidence provenance, path distance, and `contributes_to` edges. It deliberately emits no probability or opaque numeric score. The contract is defined by `schema/causal-ranking.schema.json`.

## Runtime evidence

Runtime evidence connects the reusable semantic graph to facts from one incident. An evidence instance says that a semantic observation was present or explicitly absent at a particular time, with provenance, scope, optional measurements, and ordinal confidence.

Resolve a bundle independently:

```bash
python scripts/runtime_evidence.py \
  examples/runtime-evidence/network-corruption-chain.yaml \
  --as-of 2026-09-11T14:48:00Z \
  --pretty
```

Or feed the same bundle directly into causal ranking:

```bash
python scripts/causal_ranking.py \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --evidence examples/runtime-evidence/network-corruption-chain.yaml \
  --as-of 2026-09-11T14:48:00Z \
  --pretty
```

Only active evidence affects ranking. Future instances and expired instances remain visible in the returned `evidence_context` but do not become `observed` or `absent` facts. Contradictory active states fail resolution instead of being silently reconciled.

Runtime evidence can also be selected by semantic topology scope. This prevents observations from one path on a shared host from leaking into reasoning about another path:

```bash
python scripts/causal_ranking.py \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --evidence examples/runtime-evidence/network-mixed-scopes.yaml \
  --as-of 2026-09-11T14:48:00Z \
  --scope-boundary boundary.application.external_dependency \
  --pretty
```

The same mixed bundle can be ranked for the database boundary instead:

```bash
python scripts/causal_ranking.py \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --evidence examples/runtime-evidence/network-mixed-scopes.yaml \
  --as-of 2026-09-11T14:48:00Z \
  --scope-boundary boundary.application.database \
  --pretty
```

Selectors can also use `--scope-entity` and exact `--scope-attribute KEY=VALUE` matches. When a scope query is supplied, evidence that cannot be proven applicable to that scope is excluded conservatively and listed in `scope_filtered_instance_ids`. Boundary scopes imply their semantic source and target entities, so an entity selector can match evidence scoped to a boundary containing that entity.

Runtime confidence and measurement magnitude are preserved for auditability but are not converted into probabilities or hidden weights. The contracts and semantics are defined by `schema/runtime-evidence.schema.json` and [RFC 0005](RFC/0005-runtime-evidence-instances.md).

## Prometheus adapter

The first concrete telemetry adapter translates Prometheus instant-query results into the same runtime evidence contract. Prometheus-specific query syntax and deployment thresholds stay in adapter configuration instead of leaking into canonical semantic knowledge.

Query a live Prometheus-compatible server and write a runtime evidence bundle:

```bash
python scripts/prometheus_adapter.py \
  examples/adapters/prometheus/network-tcp.yaml \
  --incident-id incident.network.production \
  --base-url http://localhost:9090 \
  > /tmp/causcope-evidence.yaml
```

The generated bundle can immediately feed scope-aware causal ranking:

```bash
python scripts/causal_ranking.py \
  observation.network.tcp_retransmissions \
  --evidence /tmp/causcope-evidence.yaml \
  --scope-boundary boundary.application.external_dependency \
  --pretty
```

Saved Prometheus HTTP API responses can be used instead of live requests for deterministic replay and tests:

```bash
python scripts/prometheus_adapter.py \
  examples/adapters/prometheus/network-tcp.yaml \
  --incident-id incident.network.replay \
  --response tcp_retransmissions_rate=examples/telemetry/prometheus/tcp_retransmissions_rate.json \
  --response tcp_integrity_errors_rate=examples/telemetry/prometheus/tcp_integrity_errors_rate.json
```

Each vector series becomes one evidence instance. Mapping rules explicitly define the threshold comparison and the `observed` or `absent` state on each side of that comparison. Semantic boundaries and entities can come from validated Prometheus label values, while ordinary labels can become exact scope attributes. Missing required scope labels or unknown topology IDs fail conversion instead of silently producing unscoped evidence.

The first adapter supports Prometheus `vector` and `scalar` instant-query results. Range aggregation remains a PromQL concern for now. Optional bearer authentication reads the token from an environment variable through `--bearer-token-env`. The mapping schema and design rationale are documented in `schema/prometheus-adapter.schema.json` and [RFC 0006](RFC/0006-prometheus-runtime-evidence-adapter.md).

## OpenTelemetry trace adapter

The trace adapter converts OTLP/HTTP JSON trace payloads into the same runtime evidence contract. Mapping configuration selects spans explicitly by kind, name, and attributes, then evaluates duration or error status without treating trace structure itself as causal proof.

Convert the included checkout-to-Stripe trace fixture:

```bash
python scripts/opentelemetry_trace_adapter.py \
  examples/adapters/opentelemetry/external-dependency.yaml \
  examples/telemetry/opentelemetry/external-dependency-trace.json \
  --incident-id incident.checkout.stripe_timeout
```

The example emits `observation.dependency.latency` and `observation.network.connection_timeout` for `boundary.application.external_dependency`, preserving `service=checkout-api`, `dependency=stripe`, trace ID, span ID, timing, and source provenance.

Dynamic semantic boundary and entity IDs read from telemetry are validated before evidence is emitted. OpenTelemetry span names, status codes, deployment attributes, and latency thresholds remain adapter policy rather than canonical Causcope knowledge. The mapping contract and rationale are documented in `schema/opentelemetry-trace-adapter.schema.json` and [RFC 0007](RFC/0007-opentelemetry-trace-adapter.md).

## Live OTLP/HTTP receiver

Run an incident-scoped live receiver on the standard OTLP/HTTP port:

```bash
python scripts/otlp_http_receiver.py \
  examples/adapters/opentelemetry/external-dependency.yaml \
  --incident-id incident.checkout.live \
  --snapshot /tmp/causcope-runtime-evidence.json
```

The receiver binds to `127.0.0.1:4318` by default and accepts JSON trace exports at `POST /v1/traces`. It also exposes `GET /health`, `GET /status`, and `GET /evidence`. Identity and gzip request bodies are supported; binary protobuf is intentionally rejected in this first slice.

A Collector can send JSON OTLP to the receiver:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp_http/causcope:
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:4318
    encoding: json

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      exporters: [otlp_http/causcope]
```

Live traces repeat continuously, so the receiver does not retain every span-derived state. It keeps the latest evidence instance for each `(observation, exact scope)` pair. Exact replays are deduplicated, older out-of-order spans cannot roll state backward, and different dependency scopes stay independent. `/status` exposes the insert, replacement, duplicate, and out-of-order counters.

The optional snapshot is atomically replaced with the current runtime evidence bundle and can feed existing ranking commands directly. The receiver semantics and explicit aggregation policy are documented in [RFC 0008](RFC/0008-live-otlp-http-receiver.md).

## Automatic live diagnosis

A separate watcher can now turn the receiver's current evidence into a continuously refreshed diagnosis snapshot without embedding causal reasoning into the transport process.

Start the receiver as above, then run:

```bash
python scripts/live_diagnosis_watch.py \
  --receiver-url http://127.0.0.1:4318 \
  --snapshot /tmp/causcope-diagnosis.json \
  --verbose
```

The watcher fingerprints canonical runtime evidence. When the document changes, it increments its local evidence revision and immediately reruns the existing deterministic causal ranking for every currently observed target that has upstream hypothesis candidates. Repeated polls of unchanged evidence do not rerun ranking.

Evidence is partitioned by normalized semantic scope before diagnosis. Entities already implied by a boundary are treated as redundant, while non-redundant entities and exact attributes such as `dependency=stripe` remain part of the partition. This lets evidence emitted with slightly different but semantically equivalent topology detail contribute to one diagnosis without mixing unrelated dependency paths.

Freshness remains live even when the evidence document itself does not change. Each diagnosis snapshot records the next activation or expiry boundary in `next_recompute_at`; the watcher reruns diagnosis once that transition becomes due.

Observations with no causal explanation in the current graph are listed explicitly under `unranked_observations` rather than being assigned a guessed cause. Diagnosable observations keep the complete `causal_ranking` projection, including candidate order, paths, factors, provenance, conflicts, and human-readable reasons.

The checkout-to-Stripe example is now backed by two explicit empirical causal edges. `hypothesis.latency.external_dependency` explains the observed downstream latency, while `hypothesis.network.connection_timeout` explains the mapped TCP connection-timeout observation. Both rankings keep their claim and experiment provenance, and any future observation without graph coverage will still remain visible under `unranked_observations` rather than receiving a guessed cause.

The snapshot contract is `schema/diagnosis-snapshot.schema.json`; the automatic loop and scope-normalization decisions are documented in [RFC 0009](RFC/0009-automatic-live-diagnosis.md).

## Diagnosis HTTP API

The diagnosis snapshot can be served directly to local agents, IDEs, and UIs through a small read-only HTTP boundary:

```bash
python scripts/diagnosis_http_api.py \
  --snapshot /tmp/causcope-diagnosis.json
```

The API binds to `127.0.0.1:4320` by default and exposes `GET /health`, `GET /status`, and `GET /diagnosis`. It validates the snapshot against the existing diagnosis schema before serving it, so HTTP does not introduce another diagnosis contract.

`/status` distinguishes `waiting_for_snapshot`, `ready`, and `invalid_snapshot` states and exposes compact counts plus the incident ID, evidence revision, freshness boundary, and current ETag. `/diagnosis` serves the complete diagnosis snapshot including all ranking explanations and evidence context.

`GET /diagnosis` supports `ETag` and `If-None-Match`, allowing cheap polling with HTTP 304 when the snapshot has not changed. Atomic snapshot replacement from the watcher is detected automatically and revalidated before the new diagnosis is served.

The built-in API is read-only and loopback-only by default. It intentionally has no authentication or TLS; remote deployments should put an authenticated transport boundary in front of it. Design details are documented in [RFC 0010](RFC/0010-diagnosis-http-api.md).

## Diagnosis MCP resources

MCP-aware agents and IDEs can consume the same diagnosis snapshot through a local read-only stdio server:

```bash
python scripts/diagnosis_mcp_server.py \
  --snapshot /tmp/causcope-diagnosis.json
```

The server exposes two resources:

```text
causcope://diagnosis/current
causcope://diagnosis/status
```

`causcope://diagnosis/current` returns the complete validated diagnosis snapshot. `causcope://diagnosis/status` returns readiness, incident revision, freshness, and compact diagnosis counts. Both reuse the same `DiagnosisSnapshotReader` as the HTTP API, so MCP is another transport projection rather than another reasoning path.

The primary wire target is MCP `2026-07-28`: the server supports stateless per-request metadata, `server/discover`, required `resultType` discrimination, server identity metadata, and cache hints. The fixed resource catalog is cacheable for 60 seconds, while incident-specific resource reads use zero TTL and private cache scope. The adapter also supports the basic resource subset of legacy handshake revisions through `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26`, and `2024-11-05`.

For MCP hosts that use command/argument configuration, the process can be registered conceptually as:

```json
{
  "command": "python",
  "args": [
    "/path/to/causcope/scripts/diagnosis_mcp_server.py",
    "--snapshot",
    "/tmp/causcope-diagnosis.json"
  ]
}
```

The stdio server has no network listener, no MCP tools, and no mutation surface. Design and compatibility details are documented in [RFC 0011](RFC/0011-diagnosis-mcp-resources.md).

## First vertical slice

The initial slice models `symptom.cpu.high` and a small set of hypotheses:

- `hypothesis.traffic.increase`
- `hypothesis.cpu.busy_loop`
- `hypothesis.gc.pressure`
- `hypothesis.kernel.work`

This slice is intentionally small. The broader semantic model is tracked in [RFC 0001](RFC/0001-semantic-foundation.md).

## Status

Experimental. The schema and vocabulary are expected to evolve while keeping the intent and stable IDs explicit.
